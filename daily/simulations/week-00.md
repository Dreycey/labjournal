# Simulations Week 0

## Friday, June 15

### Ed

 * Created organization for daily journals for simulations team.
 * Spent far too much time creating a [bash script][1] to automatic the
   creation of each weeks journal file. Doing it by hand probably would have
   been faster, but not nearly as cool.
